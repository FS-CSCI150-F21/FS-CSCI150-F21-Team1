'rest_info.sql' will create:

Main Database - rest_info
User needed for the php scripts to interact with the MySQL database
Tables needed for features: menu, order, people counter, user authentication, inventory, and table layout. 

if PHPMyAdmin is used to import data, turn off "Enable foreign key checks."  Database tables are imported in an order that invalidates FKs.

Nov 16, 2021 - All other sql scripts will be deleted to declutter directory as their functions are now incorporated.
