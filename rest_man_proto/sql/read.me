'rest_info.sql' will create:
the main database - rest_info
the appropriate user needed for the php scripts to interact with the MySQL database
the tables needed for menu, and order capability. 

if PHPMyAdmin is used to import data, turn off "Enable foreign key checks."  Database tables are imported in an order that invalidates FKs.
